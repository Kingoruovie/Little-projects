#while loops are ways just ways of repeating a particular task in python until a particular condition is met. now the general form must have a particular statement in the loop that alters the values or what determines your repition.
#example
i = 1
while i <= 5 :
	print('*' * i)
	i += 1
#now the i += 1 is very crucial so as to avoid an infinite loop that the avoidance of a particular with no defined stop point. so it is very crucial you have a pass statement that alters something until condition is done with and those blocks of under the while loop cant run anymore
#Just like if statement a while loop also have an else part to see check game project
#the while loop functions with condition like true only but much attention must be paid to breaking the loop if a certain condition has been met. Consider the car game
#Avoid repitetions while writing codes
